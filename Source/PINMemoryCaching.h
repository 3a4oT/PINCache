 If ttlCache is YES, the cache behaves like a ttlCache. This means that once an object enters the
 cache, it only lives as long as self.ageLimit. This has the following implications:
 - Accessing an object in the cache does not extend that object's lifetime in the cache
 - When attempting to access an object in the cache that has lived longer than self.ageLimit,
 the cache will behave as if the object does not exist

 @note If an object-level age limit is set via one of the @c -setObject:forKey:withAgeLimit methods,
 that age limit overrides self.ageLimit. The overridden object age limit could be greater or
 less than self.agelimit but must be greater than zero.
